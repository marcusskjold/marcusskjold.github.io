<p><em>This is just a blog post, note that this represents my initial remarks and is a resume more or less from memory and reading notes. I am commenting on the actual experience of reading the book, not attempting to place it within the wider literature. Please read the book if you find anything interesting – this is not authorized knowledge.</em></p>

<p>The last decade has seen an explosion of growth in the border security industry. Olwig et al. attempts to outline and disentangle the assemblage of actors and dynamics that decides who gets to enter and stay within the different nation states that compose the European Union. The book is structured in four parts, one for each co-author, and is tied together by the notion of assemblage that is discussed in the introduction and conclusion of the book. Each section concerns different issues, field sites and methods and is composed of an introduction to the specific field site(s), two chapters and an epilogue. The sections are designed to play off each other, such that the vague notion of an assembled <em>Biometric Border World</em> is comprehended through the very assemblage of different perspectives. As such, the book attempts to reflect the vastness of its object of study in the structuring of its content.</p>

<p>The first part of the book, authored by Kristina Grünenberg, explores the the world of laboratories designing biometric technologies. These labs are constantly engaged in the work of imagination, employing science fiction notions, utopian ideals and paranoid speculation to invent ever more sophisticated technologies.</p>

<p>The author argues that the process of developing biometric technologies involves the mobilization of cartography, landscapes and “the wild” as metaphors for mapping the body. This observation is supported well by ethnographic material and goes well with the Bruno Latour inspired approach taken. A recurring theme in the book is established here: the relationship between biometric “map” and the unruly and undefinable body it attempts to represent and order.</p>

<p>Grünenberg briefly starts to tie this biometrics-as-cartography perspective to the development of the nation state and the colonization and domestication of what was considered as “terra incognita”. There is in other words a potential discussion of vision, science and the state that is alluded to but sadly not explored in depth. (39) To me, this is an example of the limits of the collaborative approach of the book, that on the one hand allows for a diverse set of perspectives, potentially delivering a study that transcends the sum of its parts, nut on the other risks reading like an uncomfortable collection of four different works that feel simultaneously just too short and just too long.</p>

<p>However, Grünenberg does rather more confidently tie the practices of biometric labs to the specific realm of desire, fiction and threat that blossomed during the post 9/11-era. Grünenberg also effectively demonstrates in the second chapter how these scientists must learn to navigate the interests and imaginations of other actors interested in their field, as they are dependant on funding that is secured by engaging with standardization committees as well as actors with particular desires and anxieties. The conferences are highlighted as central arenas for negotiating the positions of the labs as the engage in competition and rivalry that require skillful balancing between unveiling and conceiling of information, and a conscious positioning of themselves and their rivals in terms of technophobia and technophilia.</p>

<p>The second part engages in the border work at specific, physical, borders. Here, Perle Møhl engages with the people working on and with the borders in Copenhagen and Spain. What surprised me in this section was the degree to which many of the border guards seemed to be critical of not only biometric technologies, but often the very terms of debate that characterize the border system they enforce. For example, the border guards at Ceuta, a Spanish enclave on the coast of Morocca, seem exasperated at the continuous enhancement and strengthening of the border fence, as they recognize a vicious dynamic of escalation that leads only to more harmful and large scale organised breaches of the border, resulting not in fewer people crossing, but in more bodily harm caused to the migrants.</p>

<p>Møhl engages in a semiotic analysis of border technologies, pointing out the assumed iconicity and indexicality of passport photos to a unique body that lends facial recognition technology a “dogmatic authority” which in practice is showed to be constructed through institutional negotiations and individual performance of mimicry. Møhl does also show how this authority is challenged by staff with appeals to a specifically human “sixth sense”. The staff engages in many profoundly human ways with the border technology, discussing it as having feelings or ritually checking its operations to ensure the invisible borders are maintained.</p>

<p>The unknowability of exactly how many actually succeed in crossing the borders illegitimately and with what techniques they outsmart the system hangs over the field. It is in relation to this that Møhl problematizes the practices of simulating threats, for example by randomly altering the scans of luggage to include known threats. The practice of performing “random checks” is shown to be guided by the notion of “high-risk flights” which ultimately is shown to induce a racialized vision in the border guards – one border guard is quoted as saying directly: “If I wasn’t a racist before, this work is turning me into one”. The issue of vision is a central concern for Møhl, as she argues that certain technological border practices result in a “deskilment” of vision for the border guards, as they become unable to recognize the threats not already imagined and technologically reinforced in their minds.</p>

<p>Møhl contrasts the biometric technologies surrounding recognition and identification so far discussed with simpler technologies of presence detection. To Møhl, these technologies are much more effective, but I also read a strong sense of horror in her writing as she highlights the ways it turns the vital operations of the body against itself when heartbeat detectors are used to expose people hiding in the trunks of cars crossing the land border of Ceuta. This creeping sense of dread prefigured in my reading the next parts of the book, where the horrific consequences for refugees and asylum seekers of these biometric systems is explored.</p>

<p>The third and fourth part of this book centers on the narration of stories of different refugees and asylum seekers as they seek a better life in Europe to mixed results. This part highlights the way that the border is not just to be found at checkpoints or in airports, but the ways it comes to be ever present in the bodies of the refugees themselves as they are scanned and registered in biometric databases.</p>

<p>In-formation and out-formation is a concept pair Simonsen uses to explore the central role that information plays for migrants, on the one hand as fast-moving uncertain rumours capable of suspending dispair and potentially outsmarting the system and on the other as un-erasable data legible in their very bodies. As such the concepts highlight the ways information is always in formation and the mirrored attempts at gaining in-formation while avoiding giving out-formation. These neologisms seem to me however, at least on first encounter, to be awkward and clumsy, either too specific to the methodology and specific field site to warrant their own terms, or too vague to be used for interrogating assumptions in other fields. I wished that Simonsen would have either delved more into the specifics and potential of the emic term <em>Zog</em> that seem to partly inspire her concepts, subsumed the discussion under the excellent analysis of different kinds of care in chapter five. At the end of chapter six, Simonsen briefly dips into the harrowing power the biometric database EURODAC has on some of her interlocutors and the desperation of being unable to lie when the database can read your body. including a comparison between the registration of fingerprint and standing in front of God on the Day of Judgement. This is one of the strongest points of the book and I wish it would have been analysed in depth and on its own terms rather than as the pendant to the hunt for rumours and legal advice – that Europe has seemingly built a technological system that places itself in the position of god and its (Nordic) nations as paradise while relegating the refugee to the role of lying sinner (at least in the experience of one informant) is a dynamic worth exploring in historical and colonial terms.</p>

<p>This angle was almost adressed in the fourth and final part of the book, where Olwig discusses family reunification and especially the practice of DNA testing as a means of verification. Olwig delves into the ways that the granting of refuge and after that family reunification often paradoxically requires illegal and extraordinary actions, like crossing a border illegally to go to a Danish embassy to get a DNA test, while demanding complete honesty and the performance of consistent “credibility”, for example when interrogating applicants for up to eight hours on the minutia of their family lifes, migration and traumatic experiences. I personally enjoyed this final part of the book as it to me seemed to draw from the work of the former parts to raise more politically and morally sensitive issues. Olwig analyses the way that specific Danish conceptions of kinship and the nuclear family get embedded and weaponized in the use of DNA testing, delegitimizing all other migrant family structures, even as Danish society itself recognizes dozens of different types of families. Further, it is argued that the DNA testing is part of establishing the primacy of “real” or “biological” parenthood for some of the children of these families. While it gives agency to renegotiate demanding family ties, this reads to me like a most depressing example of “integration”. Scientists and teams of case workers are brought in to the analysis, and the book wraps up with a condemnation of the way that this technologicalization removes accountability and gives a false sense of objectivity to a system that fails to live up to the humanitarian responsibilities it is supposed to carry.</p>

<p>This book has been a condemning look into the ways that biometric technologies shape border practices in Europe. It is rich in diverse ethnographic material, and the authors take great care to present a broad range of analysis while tying their perspectives together at relevant points. While I do find the subject and analysis very well communicated, I found the book lost its pace and impact while reading because of the strict segmentation of the chapters. Metatext, introductions and epilogues combined with the sheer diversity of topics made me feel like the book was a bit shallow while reading it. Looking back, I don’t think the book was shallow at all, but I would have wished to have as much enjoyment reading it as I have had thinking about it afterwards.</p>
