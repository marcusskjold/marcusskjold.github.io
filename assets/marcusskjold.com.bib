  abstract = {"While most other works focus on conspiracy theories, this book examines conspiracy panics, or the anxiety over the phenomenon of conspiracy theories. Jack Z. Bratich argues that conspiracy theories are portals into the major social issues defining U.S. and global political culture. These issues include the rise of new technologies, the social function of journalism, U.S. race relations, citizenship and dissent, globalization, biowarfare and biomedicine, and the shifting positions within the Left. Using a Foucauldian governmentality analysis, Bratich maintains that conspiracy panics contribute to a broader political rationality, a (neo)liberal strategy of governing at a distance through the use of reason. He also explores the growing popularity of 9/11 conspiracy research in terms of what he calls the "sphere of legitimate dissensus." Conspiracy Panics concludes that we are witnessing a new fusion of culture and rationality, one that is increasingly shared across the political spectrum."--Jacket},

  abstract = {This timely reissue of Richard Hofstadter's classic work on the fringe groups that influence American electoral politics offers an invaluable perspective on contemporary domestic affairs. In The Paranoid Style in American Politics, acclaimed historian Richard Hofstadter examines the competing forces in American political discourse and how fringe groups can influence ' and derail ' the larger agendas of a political party. He investigates the politics of the irrational, shedding light on how the behavior of individuals can seem out of proportion with actual political issues, and how such behavior impacts larger groups. With such other classic essays as "Free Silver and the Mind of 'Coin' Harvey" and "What Happened to the Antitrust Movement', " The Paranoid Style in American Politics remains both a seminal text of political history and a vital analysis of the ways in which political groups function in the United States.

  abstract = {The small city of Chidambaram, Tamilnadu, is home to an ancient and massive temple complex, at the center of which is the famous site where \'Siva, as Na\d{t}ar\=aja, the Lord of the Dance, performs the Cosmic Dance of Bliss, the \=ananda t\=a\d{n}\d{d}ava, in the Hall of Consciousness. The temple is specifically associated with \=ak\=a\'sa (aether, space, or sky), the fifth of the five elements which is known as the medium of sound, and \'Siva Na\d{t}ar\=aja is celebrated here with sonorous practices that include the ringing of two large temple bells. The sound piece published here, `Space of consciousness (Chidambaram, early morning)', represents the situatedness of the temple complex within the city, the main shrine at the center of the temple, and finally the immersive sonic and semiotic resonances of the large bells. The accompanying text describes a network of embodied meanings implicated experientially in sound.},
