The Handbook of Conspiracy Theories and Contemporary Religion is the first reference work to offer a comprehensive, transnational overview of this phenomenon along with in-depth discussions of how conspiracy theories relate to religion(s). Bringing together experts from a wide range of disciplines, from psychology and philosophy to political science and the history of religions, the book sets the standard for the interdisciplinary study of religion and conspiracy theories"--},

  abstract = {The small city of Chidambaram, Tamilnadu, is home to an ancient and massive temple complex, at the center of which is the famous site where \'Siva, as Na\d{t}ar\=aja, the Lord of the Dance, performs the Cosmic Dance of Bliss, the \=ananda t\=a\d{n}\d{d}ava, in the Hall of Consciousness. The temple is specifically associated with \=ak\=a\'sa (aether, space, or sky), the fifth of the five elements which is known as the medium of sound, and \'Siva Na\d{t}ar\=aja is celebrated here with sonorous practices that include the ringing of two large temple bells. The sound piece published here, `Space of consciousness (Chidambaram, early morning)', represents the situatedness of the temple complex within the city, the main shrine at the center of the temple, and finally the immersive sonic and semiotic resonances of the large bells. The accompanying text describes a network of embodied meanings implicated experientially in sound.},
